# About Me

## Career Pivot: From IT Infrastructure to AI/ML Engineering

Hey there! I'm Enzo Lucchesi, an IT professional making an exciting transition into Automation, GenAI, and Machine Learning. With over 5 years of hands-on IT experience, I'm now leveraging my infrastructure expertise to build innovative AI-powered automation solutions.

Currently serving in a unique hybrid role as IT Systems & Procurement Manager at Mazza Iron & Steel, where I balance traditional IT infrastructure management with innovative automation development. This dual responsibility allows me to identify operational pain points firsthand and immediately build automated solutions to address them. The hybrid nature of my position has been instrumental in bridging the gap between conventional IT operations and modern AI-powered automation.

I'm actively developing:
- **MCP Servers** for AI tool integration
- **LLM-powered automation workflows** that transform business operations
- **Multi-agent AI systems** using frameworks like AutoGen
- **Intelligent infrastructure solutions** that bridge the gap between legacy systems and modern AI

My goal is to become a leader in AI/ML engineering, specializing in practical applications that solve real-world business challenges.

## Technical Focus

- **AI/ML & GenAI**: LangChain, OpenAI API, Claude API, RAG pipelines, prompt engineering
- **Automation**: Python, Ansible (23+ roles), PowerShell, infrastructure as code
