# My Automation Journey

## From Manual Processes to AI-Powered Solutions

My automation journey began at Cox Automotive, where I discovered the transformative power of process automation. What started as a simple need to speed up vehicle quotes evolved into a passion for building intelligent systems that fundamentally change how businesses operate.

## Cox Automotive: Where It All Started

### The Challenge
- Vehicle diagnosis quotes were taking an average of 72 hours
- Manual processes creating bottlenecks
- Customer satisfaction suffering from long wait times
- Service advisors overwhelmed with paperwork

### The Zapier Solution
I leveraged Zapier to build automation pipelines that:
- Connected diagnostic systems to quoting platforms
- Automated data extraction and formatting
- Streamlined approval workflows
- Reduced average quote time from **72 hours to 24 hours**

This 67% reduction in processing time was my first taste of automation's true power.

## Mazza Iron & Steel: Taking Automation to the Next Level

### The Invoice Classification Challenge
- Thousands of invoices requiring manual processing
- Multiple vendors with different formats
- High error rate in manual data entry
- Time-consuming reconciliation process

### The OCR Solution
I built an intelligent invoice classifier using:
- **Tesseract OCR** for text extraction
- **AWS** for scalable processing infrastructure
- Custom classification algorithms
- Automated data validation and entry

This system transformed invoice processing from hours to minutes, setting the stage for even greater achievements.

### Continuing at Mazza Iron & Steel

As IT Systems & Procurement Manager at Mazza Iron & Steel since October 2023, I've continued applying automation principles to improve operations:

1. **Process Automation**
   - Built PowerShell scripts for routine IT tasks
   - Automated user account management
   - Streamlined common support workflows

2. **Documentation & Knowledge Management**
   - Created organized documentation system in Notion
   - Automated report generation
   - Improved knowledge sharing across teams

3. **Early AI Exploration**
   - Experimenting with LLM integration for IT support
   - Exploring intelligent automation opportunities
   - Building proof-of-concept AI solutions

## Key Projects Throughout My Journey

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start Where It Hurts Most**: My first automation at Cox targeted the biggest pain point - quote delays
2. **No-Code Can Be Powerful**: Zapier proved that impactful automation doesn't always require complex coding
3. **Build, Measure, Iterate**: The progression from Zapier to OCR to full AI shows the value of continuous learning
4. **Cost Reduction Follows Value Creation**: Focus on solving problems first, cost savings naturally follow
5. **AI Amplifies Everything**: From simple OCR to LLMs, AI transforms automation from task-based to intelligence-based

## The Future

My automation journey continues to evolve from no-code solutions to custom AI implementations. The next phase involves:
- Multi-agent automation frameworks
- Advanced LLM integration
- Intelligent workflow optimization
- AI-powered decision support

The real value of automation lies in freeing human potential to focus on innovation rather than repetition. Each step of this journey has taught me that the best automation solutions are those that solve real problems and make people's work lives better.
