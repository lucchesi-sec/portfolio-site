# About This Site

This portfolio website is built upon the amazing work by [Xiaohan Zou (Renovamen)](https://github.com/Renovamen), who created the original [playground-macos](https://github.com/Renovamen/playground-macos) project.

## Original Project

The original site beautifully recreates the macOS [Big Sur](https://www.apple.com/in/macos/big-sur/) and [Catalina](https://www.apple.com/bw/macos/catalina/) experience, developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) and [UnoCSS](https://uno.antfu.me/). Some of the icons are generated using [sindresorhus/file-icon-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/file-icon-cli).
